# FluOil: Oil-Particle Aggregates (OPAs) Drift Simulator
A three-dimensional Lagrangian model capable of evaluating the influence of flow velocity, shear dispersion and turbulent diffusion on the transport and dispersal patterns of oil-particle aggregates (OPAs) is presented. The models variables include not only characteristics of OPAs (settling velocity, critical shear stress for deposition and resuspension) but also the physical characteristics of the flow field, such as mean velocities and eddy diffusivities. This model is developed based on the FluEgg model.


# Installation
The FluOil model is written in the MATLABÂ® programming language (Mathworks, Natick, MA,USA). It requires the statistics and image processing toolboxes.
